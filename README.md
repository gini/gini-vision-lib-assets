# Gini Vision Library UI Assets
This repository contains assets to help UI designers customize the look of the Gini Vision Library.

## Please note
The assets serve as an aid to quick start UI customization designs. The Gini Vision Library may put constraints on different customization options meaning that not all UI elements are freely customizable. Some elements allow only color changes or no customization at all even though assets for those may be found in this repository.

Please consult the [iOS](http://developer.gini.net/gini-vision-lib-ios/docs/index.html) and [Android](http://developer.gini.net/gini-vision-lib-android/html/index.html) documentations for concrete customization options.
